 LLaMaS is a Linux-based Service application that runs as a backround process. Its
primary job is to notify the local Kernel about the hardware devices status updates, e.g.
plug/unplug events. It is using Netlink protocol to communicate (send/receive) to
Kernel modules. "Redfish" services is used to register to its "device update" event.
